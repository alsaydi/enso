Interpreter DSLs
----------------

1. Motivations

Why use DSLs for interpreters:
- specialize for different applications
- encode knowledge about good interpreter designs
- composable, modular and can be manipulated
- amenable to formal analysis

Grand unified model for interpreters is no good!
- Either too generalized to be helpful (eg. action language, OCL)...
- ... or too narrow and lacks flexibility in expressiveness (eg. various xforms, components)

Writing purely standalone code is no good either!
- 'Black box' approach hard to compose or manipulate
- Scalability is an issue
