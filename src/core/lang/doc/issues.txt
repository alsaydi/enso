Unsupported Ruby features

- No circular imports
- Return statements*
- Transitive assigns (eg "x = foo.bar = y") that involves fields in the middle assignment
- Most types, since JS and Ruby uses different names for the same type, eg FixNum vs Numeric
- No yields*
- Cannot create hash tables with { .. => .. }
- No Array.new

Known bugs with JS converter (not features, but fixable):

- each vs each_pair in Lists and Sets --- should standardize
