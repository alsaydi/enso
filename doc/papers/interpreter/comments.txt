* What to name the different types of composition?
I need good names for all of the "things in quotes"!
- "Adding new functionality"
  - "new data variants"
  - "new operations"
  - eg reusing and customizing expressions
  - "cyclic dependencies"
  - eg stencil's Container subclassing from Expression
- "Refining functionality"
  - "specific"
    - eg adding tail cons to ensoweb expressions
  - "pervasive" (cross-cutting)
    - eg secure schema
- "Composition by meta-modeling"
- "Modular feature composition"
- "Combinator"

* OOP vs functional
- See discussion

* Fields vs objects
- See discussion
