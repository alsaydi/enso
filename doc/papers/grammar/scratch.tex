Grammar formalisms
\begin{itemize}
\item Tree based: SDF, Rascal (AST/Parse tree)
\item Action based: Yacc etc.
\end{itemize}

Enso grammars inbetween:


\begin{itemize}
\item Interpretive
\item Models not ASTs
\item General
\item Self-describing
\end{itemize}



Interpretive: parsing is interpretive, (we could do interpreter
composition to extend the interpreter for regular operators, for
instance; this could also simplify the bootstrap grammar if we can
rewrite it to not use iter\_star etc.)
