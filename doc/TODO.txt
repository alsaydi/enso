PAPERS:
* First International Workshop on Bidirectional Transformations (BX 2012) 
     Paper submission: Mon, December 19, 2011
     
Cleanup tasks
* Distinguish "all_fields" (including computed) and "fields" (no computed fields)
* Finalize: seals from changes, run invariants (close to being right)
* sanitize the loader namespace (remove boot stuff)
* move "keys" to be computed attribute
* get rid of check (its redundant with CheckedObject and finalize)

New core functionality
* implement real delta schemas and a typed diff
* fixedpoint cyclic map
* allow "listening" to changes 

Applications
* graphical editors
    (does Ruby have graphics binding?)
* executable UML
* database mapping
* WebDSL mini-language
* Unison
* Implement a version of PLT redex?

less important
* derivative parsers?
* other kind of parser?
